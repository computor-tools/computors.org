## Qomputor testing

Currently testing of Qomputor modules (software that executes smart contracts) takes place on [Syzygy Discord](https://discord.gg/2vDMR8m).

Posibility to run Qomputor modules on bare metal is being explored.

If you wish to participate, please try to compile and run [hellocomputor](https://github.com/paulhandy/hellocomputor) for start.
