# Glossary

## Administrator
A company doing administrative tasks.

## Computor
A company or a person running Qubic software doing computations according to the Qubic protocol.

## Quorum
451+ (=26\*26\*(2/3)+1) computors.

## Metastate
Information about current parameters of Qubic, e.g. rate of qu issuance.

## Iteration
Interval of time between runs of the same element of a qubic within the same tick.

## Tick
Interval of time between consecutive time changes. Ticks are divided into iterations.

## Epoch 
Interval of time between metastate changes. Epochs are divided into ticks.

## Block
Data of fixed size describing tick state signed by administrator.

## Qubic
A quorum-based computation.

## Qu
Unit used in Qubic to burn to run qubics.

## Entinty
A person or program possessing energy.

## Environment
Environment to which a program entity belongs and receives inputs from or sends outputs to.

## Effect
Input data affecting an environment and potentially outputs of its entities.

## Identity
A pseudonymus identity (public key) of an entity.

## Energy
Quantitative property of entities mesaured in Qus. Energy can be transferred to other entities or spent to run qubics.

## Miner
An entity running mining software, doing calculations for ANN training in exchange for energy.

## Pool
A set of miners providing solutions to resource tests of a computor.

## Proof-of-useful-work
A proof that a certain, useful compution has been preformed.
