# Computors

Computors are companies or persons executing [Qomputor](/computing/qomputor) software which runs [qubics](/protocol/glossary#qubic).
There are 676 (=26\*26) computor slots in total marked with two letter names starting from `AA`, (`AB` etc...), ending to `ZZ`.

## Candidates
There is an unlimited number of candidates that compete with each other and computors to aquire a slot in computors list.
To become a computor a candidate needs to pass a resource test (solve a [PoUW puzzle](/protocol/glossary#proof-of-useful-work)), and be quicker to compute than other computor(s).

## Quorum
A quorum consists of votes of `451` or more computors. Besides computor votes it may include votes of candidates. A quorum of most lazy computors includes `451` computor votes and `0-225` votes of candidates.
451 is ease to memorize for those who watched or read [Fahrenheit 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451). Quorum decisions may be about state of qubics or the [metastate](/protocol/glossary#metastate). Quorum of at least 451 computors has power to alter the metastate, 
that is to alter issuance rate of [qus](/protocol/glossary/#qu) or set the "prices" to run qubics.

## Incentives
Computors and candidates are scored according to their performance. They are incentivized by a subsidy they create themselves and split equally to their score.
Score is calculated as the percentage of [ticks](/protocol/glossary/#tick) during an [epoch](/protocol/glossary/#epoch) at which one manages to include own vote. Computors also decide which qubics to run and how many qus to burn for that.
